How does a naive Bayes classifier based on your engineered features compare to the classifier using (x,y) values? Please note that we are interested in explainable features for pose recognition, so simply putting the (x,y) values in a neural network or similar to get an arbitrary embedding will not receive full credit for this question. You should be able to explain the rationale behind your proposed features. Also, don't forget the conditional independence assumption of naive Bayes when proposing new features -- a large set of highly-correlated features may not work well."

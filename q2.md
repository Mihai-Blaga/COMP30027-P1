**Question 2**

The assumption that the numerical attributes of the set come from a Gaussian distribution is sound most of the time. However, there exist cases, like in the tree pose where this is not the case.

The issue with assuming that the attributes come from a Gaussian distribution is when, within a class, there are multiple subclasses from which it is composed. This is most obvious in the tree pose where the hands are either above the head or around the chest area (these can be thought of as classses 'tree with arms above' and 'tree with arms below'). As can be seen in both the histograms and scatterplots from the figures for Q2, attributes like x1, y1, (representing the head) and y5, y6 (representing the arms) for tree pose have two peaks and can be seperated into quite distinct clusters visually.

The effect that this has on the overall performance is evident as the tree pose (in which this double peak is most evident) has the worst performance of any other class (see in split test scores for Q1). The next lowest scoring class is bridge, within which a similar effect can be seen in attributes like x1, x3 and x9.

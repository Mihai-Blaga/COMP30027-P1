**Question 5**

Overall, using missing value as part of information caused a slight decrease in scores except for *weighted average precision* (WAP). Looking at individual poses, such as the triangle pose, downwardsdog and mountain, an increase in score was observed. However, score decrease in poses such as bridge, child, plank and seatedforwardbend, were also observed.

An increase in WAP was caused as missing value information increased precision of data with more occurrence in test set such as mountain pose. It seems that adding missing value works well for cases when there are fewer missing values in both train and test data (triangle pose and mountain) and/or there are more samples in train data (downwardsdog).

There was a significant drop in the precision of seatedfarwardbend and recall of plank. In both cases, while one score changed dramatically, the other score stayed the same, which implies missing value information has caused an increase in FP or increase in FN. In either case, the seatedfarwardbend admittedly has a relatively high proportion of missing values in both train and test data and plank has admittedly less sample in both train and sample data.

With provided train and test data, incorporating missing value information did not have a significant effect on classification results.

The engineered pose features chosen were horizontal, vertical and euclidean distance between the head (1) and select key points (hands (4, 6) and feet (9,11)). As these points could be missing or otherwise contain null values, if either value was null, the Q5 method of null representation (NR) was used.

We chose to employ the NR of Q5 because, in testing, a strong correlation was found between the number of missing values and a lack of performance in the engineered pose features which was addressed under the new NR. When comparing to the standard (x,y) features, we compare to the output of Q5 since this uses the same NR and is thought to be a more accurate comparison.

Overall, the performance was lower than that of the standard features scoring ~0.07 less in most metrics. The only metric which scored higher was WAP and macro precision but the difference is negligible.

Interestingly, it appears that the engineered features are more sensitive to missing data when compared to the standard features. The three classes which had the largest fall in prediciton quality were "seatedforwardbend", "trianglepose" and "childs" all of which had missing proportions > 0.3. Similarly, the classes which saw the greatest improvement in prediction "tree", "warrior1" and "plank", all had missing proportions < 0.2.

As such, these new features can be thought of as a dimension reduction at the cost of some performance. This performance difference is likely due to a higher conditional dependance between the new features.
